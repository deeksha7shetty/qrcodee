It is a simple QR code generator 
QR Code Generation:

QR code generation involves creating a QR code that encodes specific information such as text, URLs, contact details, or other types of data. This process typically involves the following steps:

Selecting Data to Encode: Determine the type of data you want to encode in the QR code. This could be a website URL, plain text, contact information, Wi-Fi network details, or any other supported format.
Choosing a QR Code Generator: There are various online and offline tools, libraries, and APIs available for generating QR codes. These tools often provide customization options such as specifying the size, color, error correction level, and encoding format of the QR code.
Encoding the Data: Provide the chosen data to the QR code generator, which then converts it into a QR code matrix. The generator algorithmically arranges the data into the QR code's distinctive pattern of black squares and white spaces.
Customizing QR Code Appearance (Optional): Some QR code generators allow you to customize the appearance of the QR code, such as changing the color of the squares, adding a logo or image overlay, or adjusting the error correction level.
Generating the QR Code: Once the data and customization options are specified, the QR code generator produces the QR code image in a suitable format (such as PNG, JPEG, or SVG).
Testing and Distribution: Before distribution, it's essential to test the generated QR code to ensure it scans correctly. After verification, distribute the QR code through various channels such as print media, digital platforms, or physical products.
